\section{Elements of group theory}

Given a subgroup $H$ (order $\abs{H}$) of a group $G$ (order $\abs{G}$), and an element $g \in G$, we define the left coset $gH$ by
$$
gH = \{gh \mid h \in H\} \subseteq G.
$$

We know from Laplace's theorem that every left coset has the same number of elements $\abs{G:H} = \abs{G} / \abs{H}$, which is called the \textit{index} of $H$, and $G$ is a disjoint union of its left cosets:
$$
G = \sum_{j=1}^{\abs{G:H}} g_i H,
$$
where $g_i \in G$ are representatives of the left cosets $g_i H$.
