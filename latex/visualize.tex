\section{Elements of group theory}

\subsection{Cosets}

Given a subgroup $H$ (order $\abs{H}$) of a group $G$ (order $\abs{G}$), and an element $g \in G$, we define the left coset $gH$ by
$$
gH = \{gh \mid h \in H\} \subseteq G.
$$

We know from Laplace's theorem that every left coset has the same number of elements $\abs{G:H} = \abs{G} / \abs{H}$, which is called the \textit{index} of $H$, and $G$ is a disjoint union of its left cosets:
$$
G = \sum_{j=1}^{\abs{G:H}} g_i H,
$$
where $g_i \in G$ are representatives of the left cosets $g_i H$.

\subsection{Conjugacy classes}

An element $g' = a g a^{-1}$ is the \textit{conjugate} element of $g$ by means of $a$, and we write $g' \sim g$. This forms a conjugacy relation, and
$$
[g] = \{a g a^{-1} \mid a \in G\}
$$
is called a conjugacy class. The group $G$ is a disjoint union of its conjugacy classes.

\subsection{Induction and subduction of representations}

Let us consider an irreducible representation $\Gamma$ of a group $G$. Now, given a subgroup $H$ of $G$, we can construct the so-called \textit{subduced} representation of $H$, formed by the matrices of those elements of $G$ that also belong to $H$, that is $\Gamma(h)$ for $h \in H$. This representation is in general reducible, and it is denoted by $\Gamma \downarrow H$.

Thinking in the other direction, if we start with an irreducible representation $D$ of $H \leq G$, we can construct the so-called \textit{induced} representation of $D \uparrow G = \Delta$ of $G$, as follows
\begin{align*}
\Delta_{i'j'ij}(g) =
\begin{cases}
\; D_{i'i}(g_{j'}^{-1} g g_j), \quad & g_{j'}^{-1} g g_j \in H, \\
\; 0,  & g_{j'}^{-1} g g_j \notin H.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
