As demonstrated in \cite{all_magic_angles}, incorporating the emergent particle-hole symmetry within the One Valley BM model ensures that the middle two flat bands in each valley align with the irreducible co-representations (irreps):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:matbg-irreps}
\Gamma_1(1) \oplus \Gamma_2(1); \; M_1(1) \oplus M_2(1); \; K_2 K_3(2),
\end{equation}
associated with the magnetic space group \( P6'2'2 \). The characters for each of these irreps, referenced in Equation \ref{eq:matbg-irreps}, are presented in Table \ref{tab:P6'2'2}.


By comparing the irreps in Equation \ref{eq:matbg-irreps} with the EBRs in Table \ref{tab:matbg-irreps}, we observe that the irreps in Equation \ref{eq:matbg-irreps} cannot be expressed as a direct sum of the local orbitals listed in Table \ref{tab:matbg-irreps}. In fact, if we permit negative coefficients, the irreps can only be expressed as the linear combination \( G_{A_1}^{2c} + G_{A_2}^{1a} - G_{A_1}^{1a} \). The presence of a negative coefficient indicates that the two flat bands must host at least a fragile topological phase \cite{FragileTopology_Po2018}, leading to a Wannier obstruction.

To resolve this Wannier obstruction, we incorporate the nearest higher-energy bands, which are characterized by the \(\Gamma_3\) irrep at the \(\Gamma_M\) point \cite{topoheavyfermion2022}. These higher-energy bands hybridize with the two middle bands, allowing us to isolate the trivial bands. These trivial bands form the band representation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:trivial-irreps}
G_E^{1a}(2) = [E]_{1a} \uparrow G: \quad \Gamma_3(2); \; M_1(1) \oplus M_2(1); \; K_2 K_3(2),
\end{equation}
where \([E]_{1a}\) corresponds to \(p_x \pm i p_y\)-like orbitals at the \(1a\) Wyckoff position.

We ``borrow'' a $\Gamma_3$ irrep from these higher-energy bands to replace the $\Gamma_1 \oplus \Gamma_2$ states. The resulting irreps $\Gamma_3$, $M_1 \oplus M_2$, $K_2 K_3$ are consistent with $p_x \pm i p_y$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. To model this, Gaussian Wannier functions (WFs) that transform as $p_x \pm i p_y$ under the crystal symmetries are introduced.

Using the maximal localization procedure \cite{maxlocalWFs_marzari2012, wannier90}, we find that these WFs are highly localized, supported by flat band states away from $\Gamma_M$, and by low-energy states near $\Gamma_M$. However, to fully account for the superconducting properties, it is crucial to include the remaining states. To achieve this, we define projectors $\bP$ (onto the WFs) and $\I$ (onto the lowest six bands per spin-valley), and decompose the BM Hamiltonian $H_\text{BM}$ into the following components:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:projected_hamiltonians_WFs_PQ}
H^{(f)} = \bP H_\text{BM} \bP, \quad H^{(c)} = \bQ H_\text{BM} \bQ, \quad H^{(fc)} = \bP H_\text{BM} \bQ, \quad H^{(cf)} = H^{(fc)\dagger},
\end{equation}
where $\bQ = \I - \bP$. Since the coupling between WFs is extremely weak, the approximation $H^{(f)} \approx 0$ proves to be highly accurate.

The two states in $\bP$ form $\Gamma_3$ at $\Gamma_M$, while the four states in $\bQ$ form $\Gamma_3 \oplus \Gamma_1 \oplus \Gamma_2$. The remaining Hamiltonian $H^{(c)}$ in valley $\eta$ is expressed as:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:H(c)_topoheavyfermion}
H^{(c, \eta)}(\k) =
\begin{pmatrix}
0_{2\times 2} & v_* (\eta k_x \sigma_0 + i k_y \sigma_z) \\
v_* (\eta k_x \sigma_0 - i k_y \sigma_z) & M \sigma_x
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The coupling $H^{(fc)}$ takes the form:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:H(fc)_topoheavyfermion}
H^{(fc, \eta)}(\k) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma \sigma_0 + v'_* (\eta k_x \sigma_x + k_y \sigma_y) & 0_{2\times 2}
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
which introduces a gap in $H^{(c, \eta)}$, establishing the flat band topology of the BM model.

Using standard parameters for MATBG, this mapping provides the parameter values:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:paramaters_topoheavyfermion}
v^\star = -4.303 \, \text{eV} \cdot \AA, \quad M = 3.697 \, \text{meV}, \quad \gamma = -24.75 \, \text{meV}, \quad v'^\star = 1.622 \, \text{eV} \cdot \AA.
\end{equation}

By diagonalizing the resulting 6-band model for the valley $\eta = +$, constructed from the Hamiltonians $H^{(c,\eta)}$ and $H^{(fc,\eta)}$, we obtain the results shown in Figure \ref{fig:thf-exploration}. We analyze the cases where certain parameters are set to zero to study the model's behavior.
