\chapter{Topological Quantum Chemistry} \label{ch:topological_quantum_chemistry}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this chapter we will introduce the formalism of Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) \cite{topological_quantum_chemistry2017, building_blocks2018, lectures_tms2017}. Among many things, this theory mathematically defines when a electronic band is topological, which is a concept intrinsically associated to the construction of Wannier orbitals within a tight-binding model. The principles of TQC play a pivotal role in motivating and developing a fully symmetric interacting model for Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene (MATBG).

Given the numerous mathematical definitions and concepts in TQC, we will use monolayer graphene as a consistent example. Graphene's underlying honeycomb lattice belongs to the wallpaper group \#17, with its corresponding space group being $P6mm$ (\#183 in the International Tables for Crystallography). The generators of this wallpaper group are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:generators_P6mm}.

\label{fig:generators_P6mm}
\end{figure}

Following Figure \ref{fig:generators_P6mm}, we use the basis $\mathcal{B} = \qty{\a_1 = a \vu{x}, \a_2 = \frac{a}{2} \vu{x} + \frac{a\sqrt{3}}{2} \vu{y}}$, where $a = \abs{\a_{1,2}}$. In this basis, the generators \(\{C_3, C_2, m_{1\bar{1}}\}\) for the point group $6mm$ act like:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:generators_P6mm}
\begin{cases}
\; C_3 \a_1 = -\a_1+\a_2, \\
\; C_3 \a_2 = -\a_1,
\end{cases}
\quad
\begin{cases}
\; C_2\a_1 = -\a_1, \\
\; C_2\a_2 = -\a_2,
\end{cases}
\quad
\begin{cases}
\; m_{1\bar{1}} \a_1 = \a_2, \\
\; m_{1\bar{1}} \a_2 = \a_1.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The 6-fold rotation is given by $\{C_6 \mid 0\} = \{C_2 \mid 0\} \{C_3 \mid 0\}^{-1}$, and its action is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:C6_rotation_P6mm}
\begin{cases}
\; C_6 \a_1 = \a_2, \\
\; C_6 \a_2 = -\a_1 + \a_2.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

In the following section, we will introduce a series of mathematical definitions, including the concept of Wyckoff positions, which is fundamental in crystallography. These definitions are essential for constructing a band representation, a critical tool for classifying topological materials within the TQC framework. To enhance understanding, we will consistently use the honeycomb lattice as a guiding example to illustrate and clarify these concepts.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Orbit}] \label{def:orbit_q}
Given a point \(\q\), the \textit{orbit} of \(\q\) is the set of all points \textbf{within the same unit cell} that are related to \(\q\) by symmetry elements of the space group \(G\), i.e.,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:orbit_of_q}
\text{Orb}(\q) = G \q = \{g \q \mid g \in G\}.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{ex:orbit_1a2b3c}
In Figure \ref{fig:unitcell_q1q2q3q4q5}, using the basis $\mathcal{B} = \{\a_1, \a_2\}$, consider the points \(\textcolor{red}{\varhexagonblack} = \q_1 = (0,0)\), \(\textcolor{blue}{\mdblksquare} = \q_2 = \qty(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})\), \(\textcolor{green}{\bigstar} = \q_3 = \qty(\frac{1}{2}, 0)\), \(\textcolor{magenta}{\varheartsuit} = \q_4 = \qty(\frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6})\), and \(\textcolor{orange}{\spadesuit} = \q_5 = \qty(\frac{1}{4}, 0)\).

Note that the unit cell, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:unitcell_limit}, excludes points that are equivalent under translations by Bravais lattice vectors. By applying all symmetry elements of \(G\) to the points \(\q_1, \q_2, \q_3, \q_4, \q_5\) and retaining only those that lie within the same unit cell, the resulting orbits are represented by the symbols \(\textcolor{red}{\varhexagonblack}\), \(\textcolor{blue}{\mdblksquare}\), \(\textcolor{green}{\bigstar}\), \(\textcolor{magenta}{\varheartsuit}\), and \(\textcolor{orange}{\spadesuit}\), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:unitcell_orbitsymbols}.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Site-symmetry group / Stabilizer group}] \label{def:sitesym}
The site-symmetry group of a position $\q$ is the subgroup of operations $g \in G$ that leave $\q$ fixed.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:site-symmetry_def}
G_\q = \{g \mid g \q = \q\} \subseteq G.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\textit{Remarks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The site-symmetry group \( G_\q \) may include elements \(\{R \mid \r\}\) with \(\r \neq \0\).
\item Since any site-symmetry group leaves a point invariant, it is isomorphic to one of the crystallographic point groups: $32$ in three dimensions and $10$ in two dimensions.

\end{itemize}

\begin{example} \label{ex:site-symmetry_groups_p6mm}
Let us identify the site-symmetry groups of points $\q_1$, $\q_2$, $\q_3$, $\q_4$ and $\q_5$.

\begin{itemize}
\item The point $\textcolor{orange}{\spadesuit} = \q_5 = \qty(\frac{1}{4}, 0)$ has a site-symmetry group \(G_{\q_5}\) with the identity $\{E \mid 0\}$ and $\{m_{x} \mid 0\}$ (reflection by the $x$-axis) as symmetry elements. This makes $G_{\q_5}$ isomorphic to $D_1$ (or $C_s$).
\begin{equation} \label{eq:site-symmetry-q5}
\{m_{x} \mid 0\} \q_5 = m_x \qty(\frac{1}{4} \a_1) = m_x \qty(\frac{a}{4} \vu{x}) = \frac{a}{4} \vu{x} = \frac{1}{4} \a_1 = \q_5.
\end{equation}


\item The point \(\textcolor{magenta}{\varheartsuit} = \q_4 = \qty(\frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6})\) has a site-symmetry group \(G_{\q_4}\) with only the identity $\{E \mid 0\}$ and $\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}$ as symmetry elements. This also makes $G_{\q_4}$ isomorphic to $D_1$ (or $C_s$).
\begin{align} \label{eq:site-symmetry-q4}
\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\} \q_4 &= m_{1\cc{1}}\qty(\frac{1}{6} \a_1 + \frac{1}{6} \a_2) = \frac{1}{6} \a_2 + \frac{1}{6} \a_1 = \q_4.
\end{align}

\item The point \(\textcolor{green}{\bigstar} = \q_3 = \qty(\frac{1}{2}, 0)\) has a site-symmetry group \(G_{\q_3}\), which is isomorphic to \(D_2\) (or $C_{2v}$). We can choose its generators to be $\{C_2 \mid \a_1\}$ and $\{m_{x}\mid 0\}$.
\begin{align} \label{eq:site-symmetry-q3}
\{C_2 \mid \a_1\} \q_3 &= C_2 \q_3 + \a_1 = -\q_3 + \a_1 = -\frac{1}{2} \a_1 + \a_1 = \q_3, \\
\{m_{x} \mid 0\} \q_3 &= m_x \qty(\frac{1}{2} \a_1) = m_x \qty(\frac{a}{2} \vu{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \a_1 = \q_3.
\end{align}

\item The point $\textcolor{blue}{\mdblksquare} = \q_2 = \qty(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$ has site-symmetry group $G_{\q_2}$ isomorphic to $D_3$ (or $C_{3v}$), and its generators are chosen $\{C_3 \mid \a_1\}$ and $\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}$.
\begin{align} \label{eq:site-symmetry-q2}
\{C_3 \mid \a_1\} \q_2 &= C_3 \qty(\frac{1}{3} \a_1 + \frac{1}{3} \a_2) + \a_1 = \frac{1}{3} \qty(-2\a_1 + \a_2) + \a_1 =
\frac{1}{3} (\a_1 + \a_2) = \q_2, \\
\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\} \q_2 &= m_{1\cc{1}} \qty(\frac{1}{3} \a_1 + \frac{1}{3} \a_2) =
\frac{1}{3} \a_2 + \frac{1}{3} \a_1 = \q_2.
\end{align}

\item The point \(\textcolor{red}{\varhexagonblack} = \q_1 = (0,0)\) has a site-symmetry group \(G_{\q_1}\) isomorphic to \(D_6\) (or $C_{6v}$), with generators \(\{C_3 \mid 0\}\), \(\{C_2 \mid 0\}\), and \(\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}\). Since \(\q_1 = \0\) is the origin, it is evident that the action of any generator \(g\) on \(\q_1\) leaves it unchanged:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:site-symmetry-q1}
g \q_1 = \0 = \q_1, \quad \text{for all } g \in G_{\q_1}.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\end{example}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Wyckoff position}] \label{def:wyckpos}
A \textit{Wyckoff position} \( \q \) refers to any (real space) position within the unit cell of the crystal. Some Wyckoff positions are \textit{special}, meaning they are left invariant by certain symmetry operations (other than the identity $\{E \mid 0\}$). The \textit{multiplicity} $n$ of a Wyckoff position is the number of distinct positions in its orbit within the same unit cell, $n = \abs{\text{Orb}(q)}$. A Wyckoff position is generally denoted as \( n\ell \), where \( \ell \) is an alphabetical label that designates the increasing size of the site-symmetry group associated with the position.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{ex:wyckpos_q1q2q3q4q5}
The Wyckoff positions \( \q_1 = \textcolor{red}{\varhexagonblack} \), \( \q_2 = \textcolor{blue}{\mdblksquare} \), \( \q_3 = \textcolor{green}{\bigstar} \), \( \q_4 = \textcolor{magenta}{\varheartsuit} \), and \( \q_5 = \textcolor{orange}{\spadesuit} \) are respectively labeled as \( \textcolor{red}{1a} \), \( \textcolor{blue}{2b} \), \( \textcolor{green}{3c} \), \( \textcolor{magenta}{6d} \), and \( \textcolor{orange}{6e} \), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:unitcell_orbitsymbols}.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Coset representatives}] \label{def:cosetrep_wyckoff}
The \textit{coset representatives} of the site-symmetry group are the elements \( g_\alpha \) that generate the orbit of a Wyckoff position \( \q \), with each element in the orbit given by \( \q_\alpha = g_\alpha \q \). The number of coset representatives corresponds to the multiplicity of the Wyckoff position.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{ex:coset_representatives_q1q2q3q4q5}
For the points $\q_1 = \textcolor{red}{\varhexagonblack}$, $\q_2 = \textcolor{blue}{\mdblksquare}$, $\q_3 = \textcolor{green}{\bigstar}$, $\q_4 = \textcolor{magenta}{\varheartsuit}$ and $\q_5 = \textcolor{orange}{\spadesuit}$, we can choose coset representatives as
\begin{align}
\text{Orb}(\q_1) &= \qty{\{E\mid 0\} \q_1}, \nonumber \\
                 &= \qty{\qty(0,0)}; \label{eq:orbit_q1} \\
\text{Orb}(\q_2) &= \qty{\{E\mid 0\} \q_2, \{C_6\mid 0\} \q_2}, \label{eq:orbit_q2} \nonumber \\
                 &= \qty{\qty(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3}),\qty(-\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})}; \\
\text{Orb}(\q_3) &= \qty{\{E\mid 0\} \q_3, \{C_6\mid 0\} \q_3, \{C_6^2\mid 0\} \q_3}, \label{eq:orbit_q3} \nonumber \\
                 &= \qty{\qty(\frac{1}{2},0),\qty(0,\frac{1}{2}),\qty(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})}; \\
\text{Orb}(\q_4) &= \qty{\{E\mid 0\} \q_4, \{C_6\mid 0\} \q_4, \{C_6^2\mid 0\} \q_4, \{C_6^3\mid 0\} \q_4, \{C_6^4\mid 0\} \q_4, \{C_6^5\mid 0\} \q_4}, \label{eq:orbit_q4} \nonumber \\
                 &= \qty{\qty(\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{6}),\qty(-\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{3}),\qty(-\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{6}),\qty(-\frac{1}{6},-\frac{1}{6}),\qty(\frac{1}{6},-\frac{1}{3}),\qty(\frac{1}{3},-\frac{1}{6})}; \\
\text{Orb}(\q_5) &= \qty{\{E\mid 0\} \q_5, \{C_6\mid 0\} \q_5, \{C_6^2\mid 0\} \q_5, \{C_6^3\mid 0\} \q_5, \{C_6^4\mid 0\} \q_5, \{C_6^5\mid 0\} \q_5}, \label{eq:orbit_q5} \nonumber \\
                 &= \qty{\qty(\frac{1}{4},0),\qty(0,\frac{1}{4}),\qty(-\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}),\qty(-\frac{1}{4},0),\qty(0,-\frac{1}{4}),\qty(\frac{1}{4},-\frac{1}{4})}.
\end{align}
For example, in Equation \ref{eq:orbit_q3}, the coset representatives of $G_{\q_2}$ are $g_1 = \{E\mid 0\}$ and $g_2 = \{C_6\mid 0\}$.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}[\textbf{Coset decomposition}] \label{lemma:cosetdecomp_wyckoff}
Let \( \q \) be a Wyckoff position in a space group \( G \). The coset decomposition of \( G \) with respect to \( \q \) is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coset_decomp_wyckoff}
G = \bigcup_\alpha g_\alpha (G_{\q} \ltimes \Z^d),
\end{equation}
where \( \Z^d \) represents the group of lattice translations, \(\{E\mid \t\}\), with \(\t = \sum_{i=1}^d n_i \a_i\), where \( n_i \in \Z \) and \(\{\a_i\}\) are the primitive lattice vectors in \( d \) dimensions.

This decomposition means that for any \( g \in G \), we can write \( g = \{E \mid \t\} g_\alpha h \), for some translation \(\t\), coset representative \( g_\alpha \), and \( h \in G_\q \). Applying \( \q \) to both sides:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coset_decomp_translation_t_step1}
g \q = \{E \mid \t\} g_\alpha h \q = \{E \mid \t\} g_\alpha \q = \{E \mid \t\} \q_\alpha = \q_\alpha + \t,
\end{equation}
which leads to
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coset_decomp_translation_t}
\t = g \q - \q_\alpha.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[\textbf{Conjugate site-symmetry groups}] \label{lemma:conjugate_group_G_qalpha}
Positions \(\q\) and \(\q_\alpha\) on the same orbit are connected by the relation \(\q_\alpha = g_\alpha \q\), where \(g_\alpha\) is a coset representative. For \(h \in G_\q\), the following holds:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:conjugate_group_qalpha}
h \q = \q \implies h g_\alpha^{-1} \q_\alpha = g_\alpha^{-1} \q_\alpha \implies
\qty(g_\alpha h g_\alpha^{-1}) \q_\alpha = \q_\alpha \implies
g_\alpha h g_\alpha^{-1} \in G_{\q_\alpha}.
\end{equation}
Consequently, the site-symmetry groups of points on the same orbit are conjugates of each other, satisfying \(G_{\q_\alpha} = g_\alpha G_\q g_\alpha^{-1}\).
\end{lemma}


\begin{definition}[\textbf{Maximal Wyckoff position}] \label{def:maximal_wyckpos}
A site-symmetry group is \textit{non-maximal} if there exists a finite group $H \neq G_\q$, such that $G_\q \subseteq H \subseteq G$. A site-symmetry group that is not non-maximal is \textit{maximal}. A Wyckoff position $\q$ is said to be \textit{maximal} if its site-symmetry group $G_\q$ is maximal.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{ex:maximal_wyckpos_example}
We have \( D_1 \cong G_{\q_4} \subset G_{\q_2} \) and \( D_1 \cong G_{\q_5} \subset G_{\q_3} \), which implies that \(\q_4\) and \(\q_5\) are non-maximal Wyckoff positions. Conversely, the Wyckoff positions \(\q_1\), \(\q_2\), and \(\q_3\) are maximal.

To establish this, observe that the only way to add an element to \( G_{\q_1} \subset G \) is by including lattice translations of the form \(\{E \mid \t\}\), which extend the group \(G_{\q_1}\) to an infinite set. This asserts that \(\q_1\) is a maximal Wyckoff position.

Furthermore, \( D_2 \) and \( D_3 \) are subgroups of \( D_6 \), and it is straightforward to verify that adding any additional symmetry element to \( D_2 \) or \( D_3 \) results in a generating set for \( D_6 \). This establishes \( D_2 \) and \( D_3 \) as maximal subgroups of \( D_6 \). Consequently, \(\q_2\) and \(\q_3\) are maximal Wyckoff positions, as their associated site-symmetry groups \( G_{\q_2} \cong D_3 \) and \( G_{\q_3} \cong D_2 \) are maximal subgroups of \( G \).
\end{example}

Having introduced the concepts of Wyckoff positions and site-symmetry groups, along with the theory of representations, in the next section we define a \textbf{band representation} (BR). A band representation is a mathematical framework that connects the real-space description of orbitals in a crystal to the momentum-space picture of energy bands in the Brillouin Zone (BZ).

At its core, a band representation originates from real-space orbitals localized at specific Wyckoff positions, where the symmetry properties of these orbitals are dictated by the associated site-symmetry groups. When a set of energy bands cannot be expressed as a band representation, it indicates that they cannot be associated with localized atomic-like orbitals in real space. These bands are then classified as \textbf{topological}, signifying the presence of nontrivial global properties in the electronic structure that cannot be captured by simple atomic insulator models.

\section{Band Representations} \label{sec:band_reps}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Consider a site \(\q\) within a Wyckoff position of multiplicity \(n\), hosting \(n_q\) (Wannier) orbitals. The corresponding wavefunctions, denoted as \(W_{i1}(\r)\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, n_q\), transform under an \(n_q\)-dimensional representation \(\rho\) of the site-symmetry group \(G_\q\):
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gWi1_nq_rep}
h W_{i1}(\r) = W_{i1}(h^{-1} \r) = \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} [\rho(h)]_{ji} W_{i1}(\r), \quad h \in G_\q.
\end{equation}

Without loss of generality, let the equivalent sites \(\q_\alpha = g_{\alpha} \q\) be in the same unit cell as \(\q\). The orbitals at \(\q_\alpha\) transform under the conjugate representation \(\rho_\alpha(h) = \rho(g_\alpha^{-1} h g_\alpha)\), where \(h \in G_{\q_\alpha}\) and \(g_\alpha^{-1} h g_\alpha \in G_\q\). The wavefunctions localized at \(\q_\alpha\) are then given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Wialpha_galpha_action}
W_{i\alpha}(\r) = g_\alpha W_{i1}(\r) = W_{i1}(g_\alpha^{-1} \r),
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha = 1, \ldots, n\) indexes the equivalent sites that belong to the Wyckoff position of multiplicity \(n\). The wavefunctions on other unit cells are obtained by applying a translation operator, such that:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:translated_Wialpha}
\sg{E}{\t_\mu} W_{i\alpha}(\r) = W_{i\alpha}(\r-\t_\mu),
\end{equation}
where $\t_\mu$ is a Bravais lattice vector.

There are \(n \times n_\q \times N\) wavefunctions \(W_{i\alpha}(\r - \t_\mu)\), where \(N \to \infty\) is the number of unit cells in the system. To determine their transformation properties under an arbitrary space group element \(g = \sg{R}{\t} \in G\), we derive the band representation \(\rho_G = \rho \uparrow G\) induced from the representation \(\rho\) of the site-symmetry group \(G_\q\), as in Definition \ref{def:induction_defi}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:induced_rho_G_wannier_step1}
\rho_G(g) W_{i\alpha}(\r-\t_\mu) =
\underbrace{g \sg{E}{\t_\mu}}_{= \sg{E}{R\t_\mu} g} W_{i\alpha} (\r) =
\sg{E}{R\t_\mu} g W_{i\alpha} (\r) =
\sg{E}{R\t_\mu} \, (g g_\alpha) \, W_{i1} (\r).
\end{equation}

Applying Lemma \ref{lemma:cosetdecomp_wyckoff} for the element $g g_\alpha \in G$, we write $g g_\alpha = \sg{E}{\t_{\beta\alpha}} g_\beta h$, for some $h \in G_\q$, coset representative $g_\beta$ and a Bravais lattice vector $\t_{\beta\alpha}$ given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:t_betaalpha}
\t_{\beta\alpha} = gg_\alpha \q - \q_\beta = g \q_\alpha - \q_\beta, \quad
g g_\alpha = \sg{E}{\t_{\beta\alpha}} g_\beta h \implies h = g_\beta^{-1} \{E\mid -\t_{\beta\alpha}\} g g_\alpha.
\end{equation}

Following the derivation from Equation \ref{eq:induced_rho_G_wannier_step1}:
\begin{align}
\rho_G(g) W_{i\alpha}(\r-\t_\mu) &=
\sg{E}{R\t_\mu} \qty(\sg{E}{\t_{\beta\alpha}} g_\beta h) W_{i1}(\r) \\
&= \sg{E}{R\t_\mu + \t_{\beta\alpha}} g_\beta \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} [\rho(h)]_{ji} W_{j1}(\r) \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} \sg{E}{R\t_\mu + \t_{\beta\alpha}} [\rho(h)]_{ji} W_{j\beta}(\r) \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} [\rho(h)]_{ji} W_{j\beta}(\r - R\t_\mu - \t_{\beta\alpha}). \label{eq:wannier_rep}
\end{align}

\n

Next, we define the Bloch functions \(a_{i\alpha}(\k,\r)\) to bridge the local symmetries of \(G_\q\) with the energy bands in momentum space.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:bloch_functions}
a_{i\alpha}(\k, \r) = \sum_{\mu} e^{i\k\vdot\t_\mu} W_{i\alpha}(\r-\t_\mu).
\end{equation}

Using Equation \ref{eq:wannier_rep}, the Bloch functions transform as
\begin{align}
\rho_G(g) a_{i\alpha}(\k,\r) &=
\rho_G(g) \sum_{\mu} e^{i\k\vdot\t_\mu} W_{i\alpha}(\r-\t_\mu) \\
&= \sum_{\mu} e^{i\k\vdot\t_\mu} \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} [\rho(h)]_{ji} W_{j\beta}(\r-R\t_\mu-\t_{\beta\alpha}) \\
& = e^{-i(R\k)\vdot\t_{\beta\alpha}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} [\rho(h)]_{ji} \sum_{\mu} e^{i(R\k)\vdot(R\t_\mu+\t_{\beta\alpha})} W_{j\beta}(\r-R\t_\mu-\t_{\beta\alpha}) \\
&= e^{-i(R\k)\vdot\t_{\beta\alpha}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} [\rho(h)]_{ji} \, a_{j\beta}(R\k, \r). \label{eq:bloch_rep}
\end{align}

At Equation \ref{eq:bloch_rep}, we have derived a representation \( \rho_G \), which acts on any element \( g \in G \) of the full space group. The action of \( \rho_G \) is determined by its effect on the Bloch functions \( a_{i\alpha}(\k, \r) \), which are eigenfunctions of a Bloch Hamiltonian \( H_\k(\r) \) and give rise to energy bands. This representation \( \rho_G \) is thus referred to as a \textbf{band representation}.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Band Representation}] \label{def:band_representation}
The \textit{band representation} \(\rho_G\), induced from an \( n_q \)-dimensional representation \( \rho \) of the site-symmetry group \( G_\q \) for a Wyckoff position \( \q \) with orbit \(\text{Orb}(\q) = \{ \q_\alpha = g_\alpha \q \} \), is defined by its action on the Bloch functions as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:band_representation_definition}
(\rho_G(g) a)_{i\alpha}(\k,\r) = e^{-i(R\k)\vdot\t_{\beta\alpha}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_q} [\rho(h)]_{ji} \, a_{j\beta}(R\k, \r),
\end{equation}
where \( h \) and \( \t_{\beta\alpha} \) are determined by Equation \ref{eq:t_betaalpha}. For each \( g \in G \), the index \( \beta \) is determined by the unique coset of \( G \) in Equation \ref{eq:coset_decomp_wyckoff} that contains the element \( g g_\alpha = \{E \mid \t_{\beta\alpha}\} g_\beta h \).

It is important to note that the choice of representatives \( g_\alpha \) must remain fixed throughout the construction to ensure a consistent definition of \( \rho_G \).
\end{definition}

Note that \( \rho_G(g) \), in its matrix form, consists of infinitely many \( (n \cdot n_q) \times (n \cdot n_q) \) blocks, each labeled by a pair \( (\k', \k) \), corresponding to Bloch functions indexed by \( \k' \) and \( \k \). For a given \( g = \sg{R}{\t} \in G \), and for each set of columns corresponding to \( \k \), there is exactly one non-zero block, identified by \( \k' = R\k \). This block is denoted by \( \rho_G^\k(g) \), and its matrix elements are given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:k_block_inducedrep_jbia}
\qty[\rho_G^\k(g)]_{j\beta,i\alpha} = e^{-i(R\k)\vdot\t_{\beta\alpha}}\rho_{ji}(g_\beta^{-1}\sg{E}{-\t_{\beta\alpha}}gg_\alpha).
\end{equation}

The complete set of matrices \( \rho_G^\k(g) \), for each \( \k \) in the first Brillouin zone (BZ), contains all the non-zero elements of \( \rho_G(g) \) and fully determines the band representation. In practice, it is more convenient to consider this set of matrices for each \( \k \in \text{BZ} \), where the symmetry elements are restricted to those that satisfy \( \k' = R\k \). This restriction corresponds to a subduction to the group \( G_\k \), which describes the symmetries of a specific momentum point \( \k \).

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Little group}]
Two reciprocal space vectors $\k_1$ and $\k_2$ are said to be equivalent, $\k_1 \equiv \k_2$, if $\k_2 - \k_1$ is a reciprocal lattice vector. The \textit{little group} $G_\k$ of a vector $\k$ in reciprocal space is the set of elements $g \in G$ such that $g \k \equiv \k$. The action of space group elements on reciprocal space is defined by
$$
g\k = \sg{R}{\t}\k = R\k.
$$
For each $\k$, notice that $G_\k$ is infinite because if $g \in G_\k$, the operation of $g$ followed by any Bravais lattice translation also belongs to $G_\k$.
\end{definition}

\n

The set \(\{\rho_G^\k(g) \mid g \in G_\k\}\) forms an \((n \cdot n_q) \times (n \cdot n_q)\) subduced representation \(\rho_G^\k = \rho_G \downarrow G_\k\) of the little group \(G_\k\). Despite \(G_\k\) being infinite, the representations of two space group operations, \(\sg{R}{\t}\) and \(\sg{R}{\t + \t_1}\), where \(\t_1\) is a Bravais lattice translation, differ only by an overall phase factor \(e^{-i(R\k) \vdot \t_1} = e^{i\k \vdot \t_1}\).

The characters of \( \rho_G^\k \), analogous to the expression for the characters of induced representations in Corollary \ref{coro:character_of_induced_rep}, are given for \( g \in G_\k \) as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:}
\chi^{\qty(\rho_G^\k)}(g) =
\sum_{\substack{\alpha=1 \\ g_\alpha^{-1}\sg{E}{-\t_{\alpha\alpha}}g g_\alpha \in G_\q}}^n e^{-i(R\k)\vdot\t_{\alpha\alpha}}
\chi^{(\rho)}\qty(g_\alpha^{-1}\sg{E}{-\t_{\alpha\alpha}}g g_\alpha).
\end{equation}

To determine the number of times each irrep \(\sigma_i^\k\) of \(G_\k\) appears in the representation \(\rho_G^\k = \rho_G \downarrow G_\k\), denoted by \(r_i^\k\), we use the decomposition
\begin{equation} \label{eq:induce_subduce}
(\rho \uparrow G) \downarrow G_\k \equiv \bigoplus_i r_i^\k \sigma_i^\k,
\end{equation}
where ``\(\equiv\)'' signifies the equivalence of representations. The multiplicities \(r_i^\k\) can be computed using the \textit{Reduction Formula} \ref{eq:reduction_formula}.

In practice, the Bilbao Crystallographic Server \cite{bilbao_1} provides a suite of tools designed to analyze the symmetry properties of crystals associated with specific space groups. The programs \texttt{BANDREP} and \texttt{MBANDREP} are particularly effective for computing the decompositions described in Equation \ref{eq:induce_subduce} for the so-called \textbf{elementary band representations} (EBRs). Zak \cite{zak1980, zak1981} was the first to show that band representations can be uniquely decomposed into smaller, irreducible EBRs, which are now comprehensively tabulated on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server \cite{topological_quantum_chemistry2017, bilbao_1}. In Section \ref{sec:EBRs_topological}, we will introduce the foundational aspects of this theory, and in Section \ref{sec:spinful_graphene}, we will return to the explicit honeycomb lattice example to illustrate the construction of a band representation for a topological system, specifically the spinful graphene or the Kane-Mele model \cite{kane-mele2005}.

\section{Elementary Band Representations} \label{sec:EBRs_topological}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Two band representations are considered equivalent (distinct from the sense described in Definition \ref{def:equiv_representations}) if they can be continuously deformed into each other without closing energy gaps or breaking symmetries, analogous to the concept of homotopy in topology. This notion of equivalence is crucial for classifying electronic band structures based on their topological properties. By adopting this definition, it becomes possible to systematically determine whether a material exhibits non-trivial topological phases $-$ such as those characteristic of topological insulators $-$ using only its symmetries and band structure.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Equivalence between band representations}] \label{def:equiv_bandrep}
Two band representations \( \rho_G \) and \( \sigma_G \) are said to be equivalent if and only if there exists a unitary matrix-valued function \( S(\k,t,g) \), smooth in \( \k \) and continuous in \( t \), such that for all \( g \in G \), the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \( S(\k, t, g) \) is a band representation according to Equation \ref{eq:band_representation_definition} for all \( t \in [0,1] \);
\item \( S(\k, 0, g) = \rho_G^\k(g) \);
\item \( S(\k, 1, g) = \sigma_G^\k(g) \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

For \( \rho_G^\k \) and \( \sigma_G^\k \) to be equivalent, it is necessary that both restrict to the same little group representations at all points in the Brillouin Zone \cite{building_blocks2018}. However, this condition alone is not sufficient. As demonstrated in \cite{building_blocks2018}, there is an explicit example where two elementary band representations (EBRs) have the same representations at every point $\k$ in the Brillouin zone but are physically distinguishable by a Berry phase. In such a case, any mapping \( S(\k,t,g) \) between the two representations would break a symmetry, which leads to the conclusion that \( \rho_G^\k \) and \( \sigma_G^\k \) are inequivalent.

Now that we have established the notion of when two band representations are equivalent, we define an elementary band representation (EBR) based on the idea that all band representations can be decomposed into smaller ones. This concept is analogous to the notion of irreducible representations, but it is distinct, as it specifically applies to the decomposition of band representations in the context of site-symmetry groups and the corresponding electronic band structures.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Elementary band representation}]
A band representation is called \textbf{composite} if it is equivalent to the direct sum of other band representations. A band representation that is not composite is called \textbf{elementary}.
\end{definition}

To address the task of searching for all the elementary band representations associated with a given space group, we identify two necessary but not sufficient conditions for a band representation to be elementary, specifically in the case without time-reversal symmetry (for a full description, see \cite{building_blocks2018}). These conditions are outlined in the following Lemma \ref{lemma:properties_bandreps}.

\begin{lemma}[\textbf{Properties of band representations}] \label{lemma:properties_bandreps}
Some properties of band representations are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Since induction commutes with direct sums, we have
\begin{equation} \label{eq:induction_directsum}
(\rho_1 \oplus \rho_2) \uparrow G = (\rho_1 \uparrow G) \oplus (\rho_2 \uparrow G),
\end{equation}
which implies that reducible representations of \( G_\q \) induce composite band representations. Therefore, to search for EBRs, it is sufficient to consider irreducible representations of $G_\q$.

\item Given subgroups \( K \subset H \subset G \), and a representation \( \rho \) of \( K \), the transitivity of induction implies
\begin{equation} \label{eq:induction_induction_subgroup_KHG}
(\rho \uparrow H) \uparrow G = \rho \uparrow G.
\end{equation}
This means that all EBRs can be induced from irreps of the \textbf{maximal} site-symmetry groups.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Topological Systems}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \textit{atomic limit} refers to bands that can be constructed from localized orbitals situated on atomic sites while fully preserving the crystal's symmetry. These bands represent tightly bound electrons and lack any global topological properties. In contrast, \textit{topological bands} cannot be derived from such localized orbitals without violating symmetry or continuity. Their wavefunctions exhibit a global ``twisting'' that fundamentally sets them apart from the atomic case. Based on this concept, we define the following \cite{building_blocks2018}:

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Topological band}]
A set of bands are in the \textbf{atomic limit} of a space group if they can be induced from localized Wannier functions consistent with the crystalline symmetry of that space group. Otherwise, they are \textbf{topological}.
\end{definition}

Band representations describe systems in the atomic limit, where bands can be derived from localized Wannier orbitals that respect the crystal's symmetry. In contrast, topological bands are groups of bands that adhere to the crystal symmetry in momentum space but cannot be expressed as a band representation. This means they cannot be induced from symmetry-preserving localized Wannier orbitals. This inability is referred to as a \textit{Wannier obstruction} \cite{FragileTopology_Po2018, building_blocks2018}.

\begin{theorem} \label{th:topo_insul}
Any isolated set of bands that is not equivalent to a band representation (composite or elementary) gives a strong, weak, or crystalline topological insulator.
\end{theorem}

%\subsection{How to determine if a set of bands is topological}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%As said in \cite{building_blocks2018}: \textbf{ESSA SEÇÃO EU COPIEI}
%
%A practical route to determining whether a set of bands $\mathcal{B}$ is \textbf{not} a band representation is as follows: first, enumerate all EBRs for the particular space group and list the irreps that appear in each EBR at each high symmetry point. Next, compute the irreps at each high-symmetry point for the bands in $\mathcal{B}$. If the set of irreps that have been computed for the bands in $\mathcal{B}$ cannot be obtained from a linear combination of the EBRs in the space group, then the bands in $\mathcal{B}$ do not comprise a band representation and, by Theorem \ref{th:topo_insul}, are topological.
%
%If the irreps that appear in $\mathcal{B}$ can be obtained from a linear combination of the EBRs of the space group, then one must compute symmetric and localized Wannier functions for the bands in $\mathcal{B}$ to confirm that they are equivalent to the atomic limit defined by the linear combination of EBRs or compute a Berry phase that will distinguish the two. This is because, it is possible for two distinct groups of bands to have the exact same irreps at all high-symmetry points, but different Berry phases (recall, this is exactly why we require the homotopic notion of equivalence, as in Definition \ref{def:equiv_bandrep}.)

%%%\textbf{REFINAR ESSE TEXTO COM BASE NO ARTIGO PRINCIPAL TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM CHEMISTRY.}


To determine whether a set of bands \(\mathcal{B}\) does \textbf{not} form a band representation, a systematic approach can be followed: first, identify all elementary band representations (EBRs) for the relevant space group and catalog the irreducible representations (irreps) that appear at each high-symmetry point for these EBRs. Then, calculate the irreps associated with the bands in \(\mathcal{B}\) at the high-symmetry points. If the irreps corresponding to \(\mathcal{B}\) cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the irreps from the EBRs, the bands do not form a band representation. According to Theorem \ref{th:topo_insul}, this indicates that the bands are topological.

If the irreps of \(\mathcal{B}\) can be written as a linear combination of EBRs, further analysis is required. One must either construct symmetric, localized Wannier functions to verify that the bands correspond to the atomic limit implied by the linear combination of EBRs, or calculate a Berry phase to distinguish between the two cases. This additional step is necessary because distinct sets of bands can share identical irreps at all high-symmetry points while differing in their Berry phases, reflecting the need for the homotopic equivalence notion described in Definition \ref{def:equiv_bandrep}.

\section{Spinful Graphene Example} \label{sec:spinful_graphene}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us consider the Wyckoff position 2b on the honeycomb lattice. According to Equation \ref{eq:orbit_q2}, its orbit have the positions with coordinates $\q_2^{(1)} = \qty(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3})$ e $\q_2^{(2)} = \qty(-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3})$. The site-symmetry group of $\q_2$ is isomorphic to $D_3$. We will focus on $p_z$ orbitals with spin up $\uparrow$ and down $\downarrow$. Remember that for half-integral angular momentum, a rotation of $2\pi$ gives a minus sign instead of the identity. Because of this, our chosen orbitals will transform accordingly to a double-valued representation of the site-symmetry group $G_{\q_2}$.

As we saw in Example \ref{ex:site-symmetry_groups_p6mm}, the generators for $G_{\q_2}$ can be chosen as $\{C_3 \mid \a_1\}$ and $\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}$ in our coordinate system of the honeycomb lattice. For the $p_z$ orbitals with spin up $\uparrow$ and down $\downarrow$, we can choose the matrix representation $\Pi$ according to \cite{building_blocks2018, lectures_tms2017}
\begin{align} \label{eq:site_symmetry_Gq2_SU2_matrixrep}
\Pi\qty(\{C_3 \mid \a_1\}) &= e^{\frac{i \pi}{3} \sigma_z} =
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{\frac{i\pi}{3}} & 0 \\
0 & e^{\frac{-i\pi}{3}}
\end{pmatrix},
\\
\Pi\qty(\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}) &= i \sigma_x =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & i \\
i & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}
where $\sigma_{x,y,z}$ are the Pauli matrices. Notice that $\Pi\qty(\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}) = (i \sigma_x)^2 = -\1 = \Pi\qty(\cc{E})$, because we are dealing with a double group. If we take the trace to compute the characters, we obtain
\begin{equation} \label{eq:characters_doublerep_spinfulgraphene}
\chi^{(\Pi)}\qty(E) = 2, \quad
\chi^{(\Pi)}\qty(\{C_3 \mid \a_1\}) = 1, \quad
\chi^{(\Pi)}\qty(\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}) = 0, \quad
\chi^{(\Pi)}\qty(\cc{E}) = -2.
\end{equation}

We see that our site-symmetry group with spinful orbitals is isomorphic to $\cc{D}_3$ and the $\Pi$ representation is actually the irrep $\cc{\Gamma}_6$ from Table \ref{tab:D3_double}.

Let us calculate the induced representation and then subduce it to little groups at high-symmetry points, in other words, compute $(\Pi \uparrow G) \downarrow G_\k$.

First of all, as we have seen in Equation \ref{eq:orbit_q2}, the coset representatives of $G_{\q_2}$ can be chosen $g_1 = \{E \mid 0\}$ and $g_2 = \{C_6 \mid 0\}$. We need to compute $\t_{\beta\alpha}$ for every generator of $G$, which when we exclude translations, can be chosen as $\{C_3\mid 0\}$, $\{m_{1\cc{1}} \mid 0\}$, $\{C_2\mid 0\}$. We decompose $g g_\alpha = \sg{E}{\t_{\beta\alpha}} g_\beta h$ (Equation \ref{eq:t_betaalpha}) for every generator $g$, and we call $\gamma_{\beta\alpha} = g_\beta$ which corresponds to the coset representative $g_\alpha$. Finally, we use Equation \ref{eq:k_block_inducedrep_jbia} to calculate $[\rho_G^\k(g)]_{j\beta,i\alpha}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item $g = \{C_3\mid 0\}$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:spinful_graphene_generator_C3_g1_induced}

Since we are working with the honeycomb lattice, the corresponding Brillouin Zone is shown in Figure \ref{fig:honeycomb_tqc_BZ}. We now focus on calculating the characters for the high-symmetry points: \(\Gamma\), \(K\), and \(M\).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{fig/honeycomb_tqc_BZ.png}
\caption{Brillouin Zone of the honeycomb lattice.}
\label{fig:honeycomb_tqc_BZ}
\end{figure}


The characters \(\chi^{\rho_G^\k(g)}\) for \(g \in G_\k\) (with \(g \k \equiv \k\)) are given by:
\begin{align} \label{eq:characters_rho_inducedrep_k}
\chi^{\rho_G^\k}(\{E\mid 0\})           &= 4, \\
\chi^{\rho_G^\k}(\{C_6\mid 0\})         &= 0, \\
\chi^{\rho_G^\k}(\{C_3\mid 0\})         &= e^{i \k \vdot \a_1} + e^{i \k \vdot \a_2}, \label{eq:characters_Gk_C3} \\
\chi^{\rho_G^\k}(\{C_2\mid 0\})         &= 0, \\
\chi^{\rho_G^\k}(\{m_{1\cc{1}}\mid 0\}) &= 0.
\end{align}

In particular, for \(\{C_3 \mid 0\}\), the characters at \(\k = \Gamma = \mathbf{0}\) and \(\k = K = \frac{2\mathbf{b}_1 + \mathbf{b}_2}{3}\) are:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:characters_rhoC3_k_Gamma_K}
\chi^{\rho_G^\Gamma}(\{C_3\mid 0\}) = 2, \quad
\chi^{\rho_G^K}(\{C_3\mid 0\}) = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}} + e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{3}} = -1. \quad
\end{equation}

%Note that \(\chi^{\rho_G^M}(\{C_3 \mid 0\})\) is not meaningful because \(\{C_3 \mid 0\} \notin G_M\).

To determine the multiplicities in Equation \ref{eq:induce_subduce}, we compare the characters of $\rho_G^\k$ with the character tables \ref{tab:D6_double}, \ref{tab:D3_double_littlegroup_K}, and \ref{tab:D2_double}. For \(\Gamma\), a comparison on Table \ref{tab:D6_double} reveals that \(\rho_G^{\Gamma} = \cc{\Gamma}_8 \oplus \cc{\Gamma}_9\).

At each high-symmetry point $(\Gamma, K, M)$, we decompose the little group irreps that appear at that point into a sum of irreps of the little group of each high-symmetry line emanating from that point. There are three high-symmetry lines: $\Gamma-K$, $\Gamma-M$ and $K-M$. Although the little group of each line is distinct, all three groups are isomorphic to $C_s \ltimes \mathbb{Z}^2$, generated by a single mirror and two primitive lattice translations. The character table for the double point group \(\cc{C}_s\) is provided in Table \ref{tab:Cs_double}.

We refer to the irreps of the little groups \(G_\k\) as points on the high-symmetry lines \(\Lambda_{1,2}\) and \(\cc{\Lambda}_{3,4}\). We perform the subduction of the groups \(G_\Gamma\), \(G_K\), and \(G_M\) (isomorphic to \(\cc{D}_6\), \(\cc{D}_3\), and \(\cc{D}_2\), respectively) to the little group \(G_\Lambda\) at the high-symmetry lines (isomorphic to \(\cc{C}_s\), a subgroup of \(\cc{D}_6\), \(\cc{D}_3\), and \(\cc{D}_2\)). This is achieved by comparing the representations of the subduction, as shown in Table \ref{tab:Cs_subduction_highsymmlines}.

With the information about the decomposition of representations of Table \ref{tab:Cs_subduction_highsymmlines}, we can sketch the band structure that respect the representations along the high-symmetry lines. A band that comes from a $\cc{\Lambda}_3$ which arrives at the $K$ point, has to arrive at also a $\cc{\Lambda}_3$ representation, so it can be $\cc{K}_4 \equiv \cc{\Lambda}_3$ or $\cc{K}_6 \equiv \cc{\Lambda}_3 \oplus \cc{\Lambda}_4$, but cannot arrive at $\cc{K}_5 \equiv \cc{\Lambda}_4$. With this restriction in mind, there are only two possible kinds of band structures, which depend on height of the energies, which group theory does not tell us.
